In July 2016 we did Mt of the holy cross and would highly recommend it as an intro to backpacking 14ers.

![Map of the available camping spots](/images/MtHC16.jpg)

There are 10 camping spots, and the sites are dispersed from each other and give you plenty of space. There is a permanent no fire rule, so make sure to bring your stove.

We got the last spot available, and it was pretty great, so assumably all of the spots were awesome.

Drinking water is easy to come by, so not too hard to run through your filter and away you went.
