A large chunk of my extended family lives in Cleveland, and Cleveland is our first time house sitting using the Trusted House Sitters service.  We are getting to house sit 2 awesome dogs and 2 timid cats in a town near Kent State University.\n\nOur goal for this trip was to get as much time with family as possible, and that was our favorite part of Cleveland.

We also got to play several board games including a new candidate for our favorite called Wingspan.\n\n**Here are the pictures of our Cleveland adventuring:** https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOLYubAsB5V2NlzohHt0FNomu8dG2mPi8C9U23ySRC7Q9Ux_ZHJjfBkl6-WTzlEDA?key=clo0VlUyZkZBTmE4MlAzbVA3SmxYTnlsQThmajFB",
