Our arrival started with pouring rain and getting dropped off in a place we didn't expect. A quick change into the rain gear and a call to Dylan and we were on our way!\n\nOur trip in Austria involved time in Linz and Vienna. Between the beer gardens and the great museums I am really looking forward to heading back. You can see some of the exhibits from the photo gallery links. \n\n[](https://photos.app.goo.gl/yiR7rLGh2G3BXbES8)<https://photos.app.goo.gl/yiR7rLGh2G3BXbES8>",
