Our arrival started with pouring rain and getting dropped off in a place we didn't expect. A quick change into the rain gear and a call to Dylan and we were on our way!\n\n\n\nOur trip in Austria involved time in Linz and Vienna. One of my favorite stops was visiting the great museums there. You can see some of the exhibits from the photo gallery links. \n\n\n\n[](https://photos.app.goo.gl/yiR7rLGh2G3BXbES8)<https://photos.app.goo.gl/yiR7rLGh2G3BXbES8>",
