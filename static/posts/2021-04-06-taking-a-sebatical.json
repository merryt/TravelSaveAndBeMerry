We have wanted to slow travel for a while, and 2019 will be the time\n\n#### Hopes:\n\n- **Digital Nomad** - I (Tyler) want to be more scrappy.\n- **Learn** - Skills and culture\n- **un-burn out** - I have felt so burnt out lately, I can focus when it is time sensitive, or for short periods of times... but if it isn't time sensitive, and it requires long term dedication,...  Fuhgetaboutit\n![My feeling toward muscling through important but not time sensitive things](https://media.tenor.com/images/c231296573f458d42ff495e64c0916c5/tenor.gif)\n\n#### Fears:\n\n- **Losing traction in our careers** - Gap on resume, tech scene will pass Tyler by, I will be viewed as flighty\n- **Returning to a bad economical situation** - We haven't experienced a real depression\n- **Having to eat into savings** - FIRE dream might be dead, but we don't want to dig into 401k or Trad IRA in order to survive.\n",
