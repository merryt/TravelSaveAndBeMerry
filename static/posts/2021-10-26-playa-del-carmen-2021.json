  "body": "Our second stop on our Mexico trip was a week in Playa Del Carmen. Randi was still working so we chose to rent a unit in a beautiful little complex walking distance to the beach that way we could easily make the most out of our after work hours. We were just a few blocks from the main pedestrian walk ways.\n\n![Photo of us under a famous statue in Playa Del Carmen](/imgs/img_20211018_073452065_hdr.jpg \"Photo of us under a famous statue in Playa Del Carmen\")\n\nA vary interesting part of PDC was being part of an environment with more \"permanent\" tourists. We ran into several people who were not from Playa Del Carmen, or from Mexico who had been there for at least a month, and didn't have plans to leave. They seemed to be on vacation, but it seemed to be a more permanent situation. The city has a population of about 300 people, but we still got to see people unloading fishing boats really close to the center of towns touristy area.\n\nFor more photos check out: [Our PDC album](< https://photos.app.goo.gl/ST3w3B85oSMnKSkN6>)\n\n![Picture of Randi and Tyler eating some yummy Mexican street food!](/imgs/img_20211023_171517147_hdr.jpg \"We finally got a marquesita!\")\n\n**Highlights from Randi:** \n\n* **hot water is a luxury and I'm grateful for it,** \n* **there is such a thing as too much chorizo,** \n* **rooftopÂ patios,** \n* **beach sunrise workouts.**",
