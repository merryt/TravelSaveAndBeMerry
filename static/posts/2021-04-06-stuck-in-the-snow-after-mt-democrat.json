We did a repeat hike of Democrat, started with the goal of getting the four peaks in the Alma four pack. \n\nSome quick stats about the hike:\n\nSaturday, May 6, 2017, 6:31 AM MDT\nDistance: 5.4 miles\nDuration: 7 hours, 51 minutes, and 57 seconds\nAverage Speed: 0.7 mph\nMinimum Elevation: 11490 feet\nMaximum Elevation: 14117 feet\nTotal climb: 2785 feet\nTotal descent: 2786 feet\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1Vx8OJtb46UZyFnL25ACkSOPMhLI&hl=en\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"></iframe>\n\n![](/imgs/democrat-hike-elevation.png)\n\nIt was a beautiful, easy hike, with a tragically challenging trip from the trailhead to the paved road.\n\n![](/imgs/stuckinsnow01.jpg)\n\n![Look at me mirin that view](/imgs/stuckinsnow02.jpg)\n\nAs you can see tons of snow in May when we did the hike, created for a really fun climb, but hard to follow the trail. \n\n![](/imgs/stuckinsnow03.jpg)\n\n![](/imgs/stuckinsnow04.jpg)\n\nBesides for a few rocky outcroppings there was snow all the way to the top. \n\n![](/imgs/stuckinsnow05.jpg)\n\nThe higher we got the warmer it ended up being so we shead a few layers for a large portion of the hike, and just put our jackets on for the trip to the summit.\n\n![](/imgs/stuckinsnow06.jpg)\n\nThere was even enough snow in sections that, we tried our hand at sledding. Mike even brought some space blankets we used as a barrior to try and speed up the process, it worked pretty well. \n\n![](/imgs/stuckinsnow07.jpg)\n\nThe real drama of the trip was when we got back to the car...\n\n![](/imgs/stuckinsnow08.jpg)\n\nWe got buried pretty deep in the snow.\n\n![](/imgs/stuckinsnow09.jpg)\n\nWe tried shoveling, using other cars to pull, if it wasn't for bad luck we wouldn't' have had any luck at all. Another SUV that tried to make it to the trail head got stuck, and a Jeep Wrangler that was trying to help got stuck.\n\nAfter about 6 or so hours it got dark so we bummed a ride back to the cabin, and set up for the night. \n\n![](/imgs/stuckinsnow10.jpg)\n\nIn the morning we got a tow from Taz that we were actually able to make it out.\n\n**BONUS Timelapse of the day before:** <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mxdv_LI5IFk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",
