Some of the most popular trails in this wilderness area are Goose Creek, Wigwam, Lost Creek Loop, Refrigerator Gulch, McCurdy, and Colorado Trail: Segment 4. We took a long weekend and did a 2 night, 3 day trip to hit a few of these trails. Our overall milage from the 3 days was over 42 miles, and contained ~9k feet elevation gain, but that was recorded via a single Garmin watch, so we have doubts. This was my first time in the area, but Randi had previously done a long weekend at Lost Creek Wilderness, and loved it.\n\n[https://photos.app.goo.gl/MqZ1VFoBnBVhq6dt8](https://photos.app.goo.gl/MqZ1VFoBnBVhq6dt8)\n",
