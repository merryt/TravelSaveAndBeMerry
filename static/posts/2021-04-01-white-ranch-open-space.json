We met at trailhead at ~9am, way more achievable then a 3am start from trail head for Longs Peak.\n\n![The group at trail head](/imgs/whiteranch1.jpeg)\n\nIt start with a climb overlooking some crazy houses. A favorite of house from the set is Heaven Bent [link 1](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/6455-Dakota-Ridge-Dr-Golden-CO-80403/2146368154_zpid/) [link 2](http://homesoftherich.net/2014/10/heaven-bent-a-35-acre-estate-in-golden-co/). We originally thought it was a community rec center, sadly it is only a house... \n\n![Over looking massive Golden Houses](/imgs/whiteranch2.jpeg)\n\n![Massive houses with fancy roofs and lawns](/imgs/whiteranch3.jpeg)\n\nAfter ~1 mile you can see Ralston Reservoir and shortly after the loop section of the trail. We chose to do the route clockwise which means heading up first. \n\n![Ralston Reservoir](/imgs/whiteranch4.jpeg)\n\nYou can see from the elevation profile that its an aggressive assent as you make your way around the loop. We took several breaks to hangout and watch mountain bikers pass by. There were also several trail runners who made us look a fool by blasting by.\n\n![Elevation map: Total climb, 1622 feet](/imgs/white-ranch-elevation-map.png)\n\nFrom the top you can also see [North Table Mountain](http://travelsaveandbemerry.com/north-table-mountain/), another fun hike that isn't to far from Denver and very doable for new hikers. \n\n![North Table Mountain](/imgs/whiteranch7.jpeg)",
