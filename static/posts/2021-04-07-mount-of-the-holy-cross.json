There is a permanent no fire rule, so make sure to bring your stove.\n\n![Our home for the evening.](/images/MtHC11.jpg)\n\nWe got the last spot available, and it was pretty great, so assumably all of the spots were awesome.\n\n![Our drinking water for the night and tomorrows hike](/images/MtHC10.jpg)\n\nDrinking water is easy to come by, so not too hard to run through your filter and away you went.\n\n![Above tree line all the neighboring peaks start looking small](/images/MtHC12.jpg)\n\n![Final push before summit](/images/MtHC13.jpg)\n\n![View from the top](/images/MtHC14.jpg)\n\n![Our classic pose](/images/MtHC15.jpg)\n",
