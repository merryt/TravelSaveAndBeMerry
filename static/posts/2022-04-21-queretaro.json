My favorite parts\n\n* Sunday afternoon sitting on a rooftop patio drinking wine and reading books!\n* Seeing aqueducts that run through the city.\n* Spending time planning for our next big adventure (Biking in europe)\n* Mentally working out how to make the most of our 3 weeks in Colorado.\n\n[](https://photos.app.goo.gl/8XEn8DWtknyd4vtf7)<https://photos.app.goo.gl/8XEn8DWtknyd4vtf7>",
