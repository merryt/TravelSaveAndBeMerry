Located just out south of Bailey Colorado there is a less known hiking spot called "lost creek wilderness". Some of the most popular trails in this wilderness area are Goose Creek, Wigwam, Lost Creek Loop, Refrigerator Gulch, McCurdy, and Colorado Trail: Segment 4. We took a long weekend and did a 2 night, 3 day trip to hit a few of these trails. Our overall milage from the 3 days was over 42 miles, and contained ~9k feet elevation gain, but that was recorded via a single Garmin watch, so we have doubts. This was my first time in the area, but Randi had previously done a long weekend at Lost Creek Wilderness, and loved it.
