HI! We are Randi and Tyler, 

![Here we are on top of Mt. Holy Cross](/images/MtHC13.jpg)

We are both passionate about travel, saving money, and trying to make a little sense of the world we live in. When we first met in 2011 we had a combined student debt load of ~$50k but over the course of 2 years we were able to get back to worthless. Since 2013 we have been focusing on keeping our spending down and income up so we can focus on things that are more important to us. We try our best to attempt new things and see new places. After living in a 490 square foot studio in Denver, CO, USA for 4 years, we sold off our belongings (except for a backpack and a few tubs of belongings in Randi’s mom’s basement) and began an experiment in homelessness in 2022. So we are aspiring minimalists. We have spent the last 4 years traveling around with our backpacks (and a prized rubber spatula), often subletting furnished apartments for 1-3 months and working to fit in biking/hiking holidays and time with family where we can. Background on each of us individually:

**Tyler** enjoys:

- BJJ 
- Reading 
- Cheese
- Bike Touring
- Participating in hackathons
- Helping local libraries and schools
- Becoming proficient at new activities


**Randi** enjoys:

- Hiking and camping (in the Colorado mountains, as well as elsewhere)
- Travel by bike
- Learning about history and geography in Colorado...and anywhere else in the world
- Creating cheap travel itineraries for destinations around the world (and hopefully going to those places…though often the planning is joyful enough)
- Cooking and learning new ways to improve the efficiency of cooking away from a home kitchen
- Wine with a view
