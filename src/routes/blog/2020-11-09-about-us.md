HI! We are Randi and Tyler, 

<ImageWithCaption url="/images/MtHC13.jpg" alt="Here we are on top of Mt. Holy Cross" />

We are both passionate about travel, saving money, and trying to make a little sense of the world we live in. When we first met in 2011 we had a combined student debt load of ~$50k but over the course of 2 years we were able to get back to worthless. From 2013 to 2021 we focused on keeping our spending down and income up with the goal of Financial Independence. We enjoy trying new things and seeing new places. After living in a 490 square foot studio in Denver, CO, USA for 4 years, we sold off our belongings (except for a backpack and a few tubs of belongings in Randi’s mom’s basement) and began an experiment in homelessness in 2022. We have spent the last 4 years traveling around with our backpacks (and a prized rubber spatula), often subletting furnished apartments for 1-3 months and working to fit in biking/hiking holidays and time with family where we can. Background on each of us individually:

**Tyler** enjoys:

- BJJ 
- Reading 
- Cheese
- Bike Touring
- Participating in hackathons
- Helping local libraries and schools
- Becoming proficient at new activities


**Randi** enjoys: 

- Hiking and camping (in the Colorado mountains, as well as elsewhere)
- Travel by bike
- Learning about history and geography in Colorado...and anywhere else in the world
- Creating cheap travel itineraries for destinations around the world (and hopefully going to those places…though often the planning is joyful enough)
- Learning new ways to cook away from a home kitchen
- Wine with a view
