TL;DR - Randi and Tyler spent the last six weeks in Portugal. Tyler still works for Memfault. We are still pretending to live in Berlin (though we haven’t been there since last November). We enjoyed the holiday season with family in the States. Next up: a two-week holiday on Madeira Island, then back to Berlin.

[After a delightful holiday season with family](https://travelsaveandbemerry.com/blog/2025-02-18-usa-2024-25), we headed back over the pond to Europe, specifically southern Portugal (because the sun doesn’t shine in Berlin in the winter). We started off with two weeks in Lagos, followed by four weeks in Portimão (which is only a 30-minute train ride along the southern coast). In 2022, we spent a few days in these towns and greatly enjoyed them…so we thought a repeat visit was warranted. It appears we are not the only ones; we seem to have found where the older British and German snowbirds spend their winter. We have enjoyed hearing all the German around us. We were surprised that in a few cafes, staff even seemed to default to German over English.

In general, we have been resuming our normal activities. Tyler enjoyed two-weeks of Jiu-Jitzu in Lagos, which he was able to fit in with his work schedule. I have been continuing to study German, doing lots of cooking, and soaking up the sun. Together we’ve been enjoying many long coastal walks, a renewed vigor for Port wine consumption, and we even found a Pickleball club (in both towns!). I had a minor dental emergency: a new crown. I was nervous about finding and utilizing a dentist in a foreign country. I felt lucky to have not only found a dentist who would be able to complete a crown molding, then fitting, in the limited time we had in town, but she was an exceptionally kind, empathetic dentist (who spoke perfect English). Without insurance, the cost ($650), was likely less than it would have been in the US with insurance. It continues to be an adventure managing basic health needs outside of the US.

One of our favorite dynamics of this part of the world are the unique sandstone cliffs and coastal walks. Due to the way the water has eroded the sandstone, there are seemingly endless sinkholes, caves, hidden-away beaches, and unique rock formations along the coast that are fascinating to explore (when the tide goes out). With miles and miles of coastal hiking trails, we found it easy to get a lot of steps in.

One afternoon, as I sat at a seaside cafe, enjoying a cappuccino and Pastel de Nata (traditional Portuguese egg custard tart pastry) while studying German, I met a delightful retired couple. He is from the UK and she is from Germany. They asked to join me (as the cafe was getting quite full) and then asked me what I was studying. My German flashcards delighted them and we proceeded to have a wonderful afternoon getting to know each other. A few days later, they invited Tyler and I to their home for dinner. They have lived in southern Portugal for 14 years in a beautiful home. We had a wonderful evening drinking wine, and discussing “Gott und die Welt”, as they say in German.

Like nearly everywhere we visit, we have found exceptionally kind humans, beautiful lands, and interesting history…southern Portugal has been no exception. Next up, we head somewhere new! Madeira is a Portuguese Island off the coast of northern Africa. Stay tuned.
