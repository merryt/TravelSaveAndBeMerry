Sorry for the short post, we didnt stay in Switzerland, but we did bike through it a few times as the path goes back and forth between Switzerland and Germany.

* We did get to see the Rhine Falls. Which is the largest waterfall in Europe. [](https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/experiences/the-rhine-falls/)<https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/experiences/the-rhine-falls/>
* We biked several big days (for us) in a row and were very tired.
