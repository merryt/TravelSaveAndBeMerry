We only got to spend a week in Queretaro and a fair bit of it I spent working. My favorite parts

* Sunday afternoon sitting on a rooftop patio drinking wine and reading books!
* Seeing aqueducts that run through the city.
* Spending time planning for our next big adventure (Biking in europe)
* Mentally working out how to make the most of our 3 weeks in Colorado.
