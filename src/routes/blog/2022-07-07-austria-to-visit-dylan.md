**Austria**

We took a bus from Germany to Linz Austria to visit Dylan. Our arrival started with pouring rain and getting dropped off in a place we didn't expect. A quick change into the rain gear and a call to Dylan and we were on our way!

Our trip in Austria involved time in Linz and Vienna. Between the beer gardens and the great museums I am really looking forward to heading back. You can see some of the exhibits from the photo gallery links.
