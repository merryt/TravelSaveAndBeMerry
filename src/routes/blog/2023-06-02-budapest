We spent April and May 2023 in Budapest. A city that is a combination of 3 seporate cities. The Danube river runs right through the middle of the town. There are several bridges that cross the river and an island in the center (Margaret Island). 

We watched two dogs during our stay. Their person is an aussie who working in the UK and has an appartment in the schengen area. Lots of spreadsheet juggling to make it work but very impressive. The two dogs were very cute and very different. The dog park system in Budapest was also very interesting. The city really loves its dogs and it shows. They allow you to take dogs on public transit, but you need to pay a full price ticket. We thought that was a little rediculous, then we remembered the bus costs ~1.30 USD and we went on our way.
