<p>This hike we are joined by Marly(doggo) Andrew, Elizabeth, and Mike! We met at trailhead at ~9am, way more achievable then a 3am start from trail head for Longs Peak.</p>

<p>It start with a climb overlooking some crazy houses. A favorite of house from the set is Heaven Bent <a href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/6455-Dakota-Ridge-Dr-Golden-CO-80403/2146368154_zpid/" rel="nofollow">link 1</a> <a href="http://homesoftherich.net/2014/10/heaven-bent-a-35-acre-estate-in-golden-co/" rel="nofollow">link 2</a>. We originally thought it was a community rec center, sadly it is only a house… </p>

<p>After ~1 mile you can see Ralston Reservoir and shortly after the loop section of the trail. We chose to do the route clockwise which means heading up first. </p>

<p>You can see from the elevation profile that its an aggressive assent as you make your way around the loop. We took several breaks to hangout and watch mountain bikers pass by. There were also several trail runners who made us look a fool by blasting by.</p>

<p>From the top you can also see <a href="http://travelsaveandbemerry.com/north-table-mountain/" rel="nofollow">North Table Mountain</a>, another fun hike that isn’t to far from Denver and very doable for new hikers. </p>
