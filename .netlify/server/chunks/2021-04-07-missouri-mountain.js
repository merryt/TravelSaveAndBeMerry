  return `<p>After cramming Oxford/Belford into one looong and painful day in 2012, we elected to complete Missouri Mountain as an overnight backpack trek…and we regret nothing.</p>

<p>Missouri, Belford, and Oxford can all be completed from the Missouri Gulch trailhead. After ~2.25 miles from the trailhead the trail splits with Missouri to the right and Belford/Oxford to the left.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Missouri2.jpeg" alt="The trail starts off with a lovely trek through an aspen grove."></p>
<p>There is a great campsite right around 1.75 miles in, before you exit the trees. The campsite has a great snowmelt stream running about a quarter-mile away. This enables a hiker to get a good 1,500+ elevation gain out of the way before attempting either 14er trek…absolutely ideal!</p>

<p>After the steep (but short), uphill trek into camp we enjoyed a relaxing evening in preparation for tomorrow’s climb.</p>

<p>The next morning was an early start with amazing weather ahead of us.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Missouri5.jpeg" alt="Andrew and Randi start off with Missouri dead ahead."></p>
<p>The morning warms up fast as we come out of treeline. Even in early July, plenty of snowfields were crossed.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Missouri6.jpeg" alt="Marley leading our crew up and up and up."></p>
<p>Marley (Andrew’s pup) was a trooper, but the rocks seemed to bother his paws near the summit. May not be an ideal hike for puppers who do not have high-altitude experience.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Missouri7.jpeg" alt="Near the summit, the only technical part of this trek."></p>
<p><img src="/images/Missouri8.jpeg" alt="Traditional summit group shot."></p>
<p>Back down at camp, time to pack-up and pack-out!</p>
<p><img src="/images/Missouri9.jpeg" alt="Cleaning up our campisite"></p>
<p><img src="/images/Missouri10.jpeg" alt="Marley is wiped out...but we still have 1.7 miles to descend."></p>
<p>All in all, hiking in and camping was far preferred to completing the full hike in one day. Plus, Tyler fair preferred the tolerable 6am wake-up call compared to 3am…but he is a bit of a whiner about mornings.</p>`;
