  return `<p>During our brief weekend in Crested Butte we elected to hike the famed Crystal Mill, as neither Tyler nor I had seen the location. This hike is a difficult down then return uphill trek. The varied terrain, ranging from woods, aspens groves, canyons, and meadows make it well worth the journey.</p>

<p>We parked just shy of the summit of Schofield Pass. There was a great parking spot right at the temporary road closure sign (3900’18.9”N 10701’51.3”W) ~12 miles up Co Rd 317 from Crested Butte. We parked just shy of one mile from the beautiful Emerald Lake.</p>

<p>In no time we had reached the summit of Schofield Pass…and with that, ~6 miles of downhill lay ahead of us.

<p>The trail then opened up in a expansive meadow, where we had a brief reprieve from the descent and the bright sunshine on our shoulders.

<p>The trail became rocky and steep as we neared Devil’s Punch Bowl and the creek crossing of the South Fork Crystal River.

<p>I thought for sure we would have to wade across the deep creek, but then Tyler found a hidden gem to the west of the road…a magical single track that enabled us to avoid the two deep creek crossings! Score one for the Ty-Guy!</p>
<p><img src="/images/crystalmills6.jpg" alt="Just to the west of the road at the creek crossing is a small foot bridge with the signage 'Bridge to Terabithia'...saved us from the creek crossings."></p>
<p>The little single track popped out right at the second creek crossing through the willows.</p>

<p>The trail then descended into a gorgeous canyon. With each mile we hiked down, we knew the trek up would be warm and steep.</p>
<p><img src="/images/crystalmills8.jpg" alt="The water rushed down the canyon along side us."></p>
<p>A large rock slide stood in the middle of the path, blocking the ATVs, Side-by-Sides, and other 4WD adventurers…only hikers and bikers are passing through now.</p>

<p>After crossing a small bridge we continued down and down into the town of Crystal.</p>

<p>Finally, our destination was reached…Crystal Mills.</p>

<p>We enjoyed some delightful homemade fudge mid-hike. We had gotten the treat the day before as we drove over Monarch Pass at the <a href="https://monarchcrest.net/" rel="nofollow">Monarch Crest Gift Shop</a>.</p>

<p>After the short break it was time to make the seven-plus mile return trip…uphill…so much uphill.</p>

<p>All in all, it was a bit longer than we anticipated, but well worth all the views and adventure.</p>
