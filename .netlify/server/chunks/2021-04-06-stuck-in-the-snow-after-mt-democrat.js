<p>It was a beautiful, easy hike, with a tragically challenging trip from the trailhead to the paved road.</p>

<p>As you can see tons of snow in May when we did the hike, created for a really fun climb, but hard to follow the trail. </p>

<p>Besides for a few rocky outcroppings there was snow all the way to the top. </p>
<p><img src="/images/stuckinsnow05.jpg" alt="It warmed up as we got higher"></p>
<p>The higher we got the warmer it ended up being so we shead a few layers for a large portion of the hike, and just put our jackets on for the trip to the summit.</p>

<p>There was even enough snow in sections that, we tried our hand at sledding. Mike even brought some space blankets we used as a barrior to try and speed up the process, it worked pretty well. </p>

<p>The real drama of the trip was when we got back to the car…</p>
<p><img src="/images/stuckinsnow08.jpg" alt="Digging out the car"></p>
<p>We got buried pretty deep in the snow.</p>
<p><img src="/images/stuckinsnow09.jpg" alt="Digging out the car"></p>
<p>We tried shoveling, using other cars to pull, if it wasn’t for bad luck we wouldn’t’ have had any luck at all. Another SUV that tried to make it to the trail head got stuck, and a Jeep Wrangler that was trying to help got stuck.</p>
<p>After about 6 or so hours it got dark so we bummed a ride back to the cabin, and set up for the night. </p>

<p>In the morning we got a tow from Taz that we were actually able to make it out.</p>
