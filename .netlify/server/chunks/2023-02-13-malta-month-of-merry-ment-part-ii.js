<p>Hi friends and familywe hope you are well. As our month in Malta comes to a close, we reflect on the things we learned and enjoyed about this historic island in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>If you are just here for the pics, check our our Malta Part II Photo Album: <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/9M3xRT89UBeeuRM5A" rel="nofollow">https://photos.app.goo.gl/9M3xRT89UBeeuRM5A</a></p>
<p>A few things we learned:</p>
<ul><li>Malta is made up of three islands, Comino, Gozo, and Malta (the main island).</li>
<li>Population of Malta is just over half a million, which is smaller than Denver.</li>
<li>Gozo is home to the gantija temples, which are manmade temples 5,600 years old (older than the pyramids of Egypt), making them the world’s second oldest existing manmade religious structures.</li>
<li>Fifty-seven degrees, with 70% humidity mean very different things depending on cloud cover, wind speeds, and/or sun-shining (some days felt quite a bit chilly, while others were gloriously warm).</li>
<li>European islands appropriately work to conserve water and do not have large hot-water tanks; thus, showers get cold fast in Malta (like 3 minutes tops).</li>
<li>Malta is an affordable and astounding country; rich in history, hiking, sea-side views, and local charm.</li></ul>

<p>A few things we enjoyed:</p>
<ul><li>When the sun was shining, we took advantage of the warmth and hiked all around the three islands of Malta; Comino was stunningly gorgeous (see post cover photo), Gozo was packed with interesting history, Malta had so many trails all accessible by public transit…each island had fantastic hiking!</li>
<li>PASTIZZIS!!! These are filo-dough pastries, typically filled with ricotta cheese. At $0.50 a pop they are a wonderful snack and sold all over Malta.</li>
<li>Tyler rekindled his love of Shandys and Randi found cappuccinos with Amaretto to be the perfect mid-day pick-me-up.</li></ul>

<p>Other updates:</p>
<ul><li>Next up we head to Portugal to close out February. First a few days in Lisbon followed by Lagos (southern Portugal in the Algarve region) to hike parts of the Ruta Vicentina, a coastal thru-hike.</li>
<li>We are now working to learn Turkish!! After Portugal we head to Turkey and we are a bit intimidated by the exotic and foreign culture, language, and customs. Gidelim!</li>
<li>Tyler is in the middle of a month without video games as his current challenge.</li>
<li>Randi has been spending hours studying locations and planning how we might spend our time during our travels in 2023.</li>
<li>We both highly recommend the new HBO show: The Last of Us</li></ul>

<p>All in all, Malta was a delightful surprise that exceeded all expectations. We strongly recommend this Mediterranean country for anyones holiday destination!! As always, dont be shy to text, call, or email us with your updates!</p>`;
