<p>There are 10 camping spots, and the sites are dispersed from each other and give you plenty of space. There is a permanent no fire rule, so make sure to bring your stove.</p>

<p>We got the last spot available, and it was pretty great, so assumably all of the spots were awesome.</p>

<p>Drinking water is easy to come by, so not too hard to run through your filter and away you went.</p>
