<p>I was very surprised by how much I enjoyed CDMX (ciudad de mxico aka, Mexico City)! It is a city filled with people, museums, parks, markets and life in general. CDMX has a population of 10 million and 22 million in the greater metro area. For comparison, Randi and I have lived in Colorado for the last ~10 years which has a population of 5m for the whole state. With so many people there are so many economies of scale that get opened up. CDMX has public transit via trains and buses, large parks with free events, and lots of museums.</p>
<p>When we first arrived we walked to the city center; we were pleasantly surprised by a marathon that had taken over down town. There were tons of athletes, spectators, and vendors. This came as a shock to see massive 4-8 lane roads all closed down to let people exercise. While walking around everything felt reasonably safe and seemed like a normal everyday fitness event. We wrote the safety and liveliness off as being part of the event and increased security. It wasnt until the next day we truly felt the surprise of how safe and lively the city felt.</p>
<p>The Anthropology Museum was so cool! It was such a great opportunity to learn about Mexico as a whole, but especially Mexico City. It was cool to see how this physical location had waves of different civilizations over the past ~3000 years.</p>
<p>One of our favorite parts of the trip was the Chapultepec Park. A massive public space with a market, a castle, museum, opera house, and tons of other things we have yet to explore. It will be top of our list next time around.</p>
<p>Highlights from Randi:</p>
<ul><li>This whole city has been a highlight! What a fantastic, charming, exciting city…I can’t wait to return!</li>
<li>The<a href="https://chapultepec.org.mx/actividad/audiorama/?lang=en" rel="nofollow">Audiorama in Chapultepec Park</a>- a section of the park with played music and offers a sanctuary for weary park-goers.</li>
<li>Templo Mayor - the main temple of the Mexica people in their capital city of Tenochtitlan, which is now Mexico City. Its architectural site is in the center of the city and amazing to learn about and view.</li>
<li>CHURROS - which are everywhere!</li></ul>
