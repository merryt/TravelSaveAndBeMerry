<p>The third stop in our trip across the country was to Cleveland Ohio. A large chunk of my extended family lives in Cleveland, and Cleveland is our first time house sitting using the Trusted House Sitters service.  We are getting to house sit 2 awesome dogs and 2 timid cats in a town near Kent State University.</p>
<p>Our goal for this trip was to get as much time with family as possible, and that was our favorite part of Cleveland. We got to tons of time with aunts, uncles, and my grandpa watching the Broncos, Indians, a musical, and dogs practice retrieval training. We also got to play several board games including a new candidate for our favorite called Wingspan.</p>
